# 🛒 Java E-Commerce System (Console-Based)

This project simulates the backend logic of an e-commerce platform using Java. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles including inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User and Admin roles (with different permissions)
- Add, remove, and list products
- Place orders and manage inventory
- Track product quantity and pricing
- Uses simple Java I/O for console interaction

---

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

The system is built using core OOP concepts:

- ✅ Inheritance (e.g. User → Admin, Customer)
- ✅ Encapsulation (private fields + getters/setters)
- ✅ Abstraction (abstract classes/interfaces)
- ✅ Polymorphism (method overriding where needed)

---

## 🧱 Technologies

- Java (JDK 8+)
- No external libraries
- Console-based interface (no GUI)
